    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Edward Gichura</strong>, an aspiring Actuary with a deep passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Statistical Modeling. I specialize in creating predictive models, analyzing financial time series, and applying actuarial principles to solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hold a degree in Actuarial Science, and my goal is to leverage data to make smarter business decisions. Throughout my journey, I've developed skills in statistics, programming (Python, R), and machine learning. I enjoy tackling challenges and continuously learning to refine my technical and analytical abilities.

        When I’m not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me exploring innovative ways to apply technology to address challenges, especially in developing regions. My interest lies in combining technology and social good, which is why I’m also passionate about agritech and sustainable development.
